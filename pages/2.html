		<h2>Chroma Hills</h2>
		<p>I was hired in 2013 to join the Chroma Hills teams as the system administrator for their upcoming gaming network. Through my time there I have set up and kept a number of servers online and running whilst providing constant maintenance on security, back end productions and web related products. Chroma Hills has over one million downloads of the resource pack and a following of over 100,000 people.</p>
		<p>My visible work that the public can views is the main website that constantly been updated to have a full login, forum and stat tracking system that works hand in hand with the network itself. From that other projects like a Google Chrome extension, billing software and management solutions have became a successful production.</p>

		<p>I was contacted to produce work for a client take a database information made by a team of Java developers for in-game banning and infraction tracking. My job was to make the an simple and clean tracking system that allowed any user to go onto the clients website and enter in a multitude of information. This involves general search applying across every column, advanced search that works in sync with any other search field that would narrow results if matches were found in that column.</p>
		<p> The whole page was completed and tested efficiently, once the product was released I then was contacted to add features such as a drop down menu to limit results by the latest time and a column system to track recent offenders. All of which had to responsive using AJAX page loading.</p>
